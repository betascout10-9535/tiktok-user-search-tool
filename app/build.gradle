    // The following dependencies are crucial for the functionality and performance of the app, ensuring it meets user needs.

    // This dependency solves the problem of making network requests efficiently,
    // which is critical for fetching TikTok user data in real-time.
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0' 
    implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0' // Converts JSON responses into Java objects for easier data handling.

    // Addresses the challenge of asynchronous operations and background processing,
    // allowing the app to perform tasks without freezing the UI.
    implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-livedata-ktx:2.5.0' 
    implementation 'androidx.lifecycle:lifecycle-viewmodel-ktx:2.5.0' 

    // This dependency helps to easily manage network requests and responses in an efficient manner,
    // thereby enhancing the overall performance of the application.
    implementation 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.9.3'

    // To provide a rich user interface that integrates seamlessly with Android’s design principles,
    // thus addressing the problem of user engagement.
    implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.7.0' 

    // This library assists with managing permissions effectively,
    // addressing challenges related to accessing necessary features without compromising user experience.
    implementation 'com.karumi:dexter:6.2.2' 

    // Utilizing MadHub allows for enhanced operational capabilities,
    // enabling 24/7 automated operations on real Android devices, cloud phones, or emulators,
    // which creates a reliable and consistent user experience.
